In this class, we will explore the importance of planning scheduling and operating systems, such as the Toyota production system and look at an example of where lean is an integral part of strategy. We will then explore how and whether there is a tradeoff between cost and availability. We will Herb Spivak, EVP of New Balance , joining us for this class. |
| 18 | Competing on cost versus competing on features and innovativeness | BMW and Apple represent to many observers the essence of innovativeness. We will consider these two companies, which also illustrate different approaches to quality and possible tradeoffs with cost versus innovativeness. |
